# Power Calculator 🔢

This beginner-friendly Python project calculates the power of a number without using Python's built-in ** operator. Instead, it uses a for loop and a custom function to multiply the base number by itself repeatedly.

## 💡 What It Demonstrates

- Manual implementation of exponentiation
- Use of for loops for repeated operations
- Function definition and usage
- Handling user input with input() and int()

## 🧠 Why Not Use **?

Python makes exponentiation easy with base ** power, but this project is about understanding how it works under the hood. It’s a great way to practice algorithmic thinking and control flow.

## 🚀 How to Run

Just run the script and enter two numbers when prompted:
```bash
Enter the base: 3
Enter the power: 4


Output:

81


📂 File Structure

• power_calculator.py – Main script with the function and input/output logic
• README.md – Project overview and instructions


🛠️ Future Ideas

• Add support for negative powers
• Handle non-integer inputs gracefully
• Compare performance with the built-in ** operator
