# 🎮 While Loop Guessing Game

This is a simple two-player number guessing game written in Python. It's a great beginner project to understand loops, conditionals, and user input.

## 👥 How It Works

- Player 1 chooses a secret number between 1 and 100.
- Player 2 has up to 10 chances to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game tells Player 2 whether their guess is too high or too low.
- If Player 2 guesses correctly, they win. Otherwise, they lose after 10 tries.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- while loops
- if, elif, else conditionals
- Boolean flags
- User input with input()
- Basic game logic

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python while_loop_game.py
