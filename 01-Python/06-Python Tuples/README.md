# Python Tuple Tutorial  
A complete beginner-friendly tutorial on Python Tuples  
Created by Karo

This repository contains a detailed Python script that explains **how Tuples work in Python** using clear examples and step-by-step comments.  
It is a great resource for beginners who are learning Python for AI, data science, or general programming.

## 📌 Topics Covered in This Tutorial

### 1. Introduction to Tuples
- What tuples are
- Tuple characteristics: **ordered**, **immutable**, **allow duplicates**
- Creating tuples
- Tuples with different data types
- Using the `tuple()` constructor

---

### 2. Accessing Tuple Items
- Indexing
- Negative indexing
- Slicing (range of indexes)
- Slicing with negative indexes
- Checking if an item exists

---

### 3. Updating Tuples
Since tuples are immutable, you learn:
- How to convert a tuple to a list, modify it, and convert it back
- Adding items by:
  - Using a list
  - Adding tuples together
- Removing items using list conversion
- Deleting a tuple completely with `del`

---

### 4. Unpacking Tuples
- Basic unpacking
- Using the asterisk `*`
- Collecting multiple values into a single variable

---

### 5. Looping Through Tuples
- Looping with `for`
- Looping with index numbers
- Looping with `while`

---

### 6. Joining and Multiplying Tuples
- Merging tuples using `+`
- Repeating tuple items using `*`

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Just run the script with Python:

```bash
python tuple_tutorial.py


(Or whatever filename you choose.)
