# 🧠 Python Data Types – Foundation for AI Programming

This beginner-friendly Python script demonstrates how to work with built-in data types — a critical first step for anyone learning programming or preparing for artificial intelligence development.

## 📦 What's Inside

- data_types.py: A clean and well-commented Python file that covers all built-in data types.
- Examples of both implicit and explicit type assignments.
- Clear output to help visualize how Python interprets each data type.

## 🧪 Covered Data Types

- Text Type: str
- Numeric Types: int, float, complex
- Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
- Mapping Type: dict
- Set Types: set, frozenset
- Boolean Type: bool
- Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- None Type: NoneType

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run the script:

```bash
python data_types.py


You’ll see printed output showing the type of each variable and how Python handles different data types.

🎯 Purpose

Understanding data types is essential for:

• Writing clean and efficient code
• Building AI and machine learning models
• Managing data structures in real-world applications


This project is part of a self-driven learning path focused on mastering Python for artificial intelligence.
