# 🐍 Python Operators – Complete Tutorial with Examples

This project is a **comprehensive guide** to Python Operators.  
It demonstrates every major type of operator in Python with clear explanations, comments, and executable examples.

---

## 📖 Overview

Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.  
This script includes hands-on examples to help you understand how each operator works in practice.

---

## ⚙️ Topics Covered

1. Arithmetic Operators  
   Perform basic mathematical calculations.  
   Examples:ption -, *, /, %, //, **

2. Assignment Operators  
   Assign or modify variable values using shorthand expressions.  
   Examples: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %= etc.

3.e — here’s the English  
   Compare two values and return a Boolean (`True` or `False`).  
   Examples:.md fo !=, >, <, >=, <=

4. Logical Operators  
   Combine or invert conditions.  
   Examples: and, or, not

5. Identity Operators  
   Check if two objects are the same in memory.  
   Examples: is, is not

6. Membership Operators  
   Check if a value exists within a sequence (list, string, etc.).  
   Examples: in, not in

7. Bitwise Operators  
   Perform operations on binary numbers.  
   Examples:cript |, ^, ~, <<, >>

8.course — here’s the English version of b 
   Learn how Python determines the order of execution when multiple operators appear in one expression.

## 🧩 Example Output

```python
print(10 + 5)      # 15
print(15 / 4)      # 3.75
print(12 // 5)     # 2
print(6 & 3)       # 2 (Bitwise AND)
print(1 < 5 < 10)  # True

💻 How to Run
 1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
 2. Save the script as python_operators.py.
 3. Run it using your terminal or IDE:
