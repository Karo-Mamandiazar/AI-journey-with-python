# Python If / Elif / Else Tutorial 
A full beginner-friendly guide created by **Karo**, learning Python for **AI development**.

This repository contains a detailed Python script that explains how conditional statements work in Python, including:
- `if`
- `elif`
- `else`
- shorthand if statements
- logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- nested if statements
- the `pass` statement

The goal of this project is to help beginners understand decision-making in Python, which is essential for **Artificial Intelligence**, **machine learning logic**, and **general programming**.

---

## 📘 Overview

Python uses conditional statements to make decisions based on whether an expression is True or False.  
In this tutorial, each concept is demonstrated with clear examples and explanations.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 1. Basic If Statements
Demonstrates how Python evaluates conditions and executes code when the condition is true.

### 🔹 2. If / Else Statements  
Shows how Python chooses between two possible actions.

### 🔹 3. If / Elif / Else Chains  
Explains how to check multiple conditions in order.

### 🔹 4. Comparison Operators  
Examples using:

==   !=   <   <=   >   >=

### 🔹 5. Logical Operators  
Covers:

and   or   not

### 🔹 6. Nested If Statements  
Shows how an if statement can exist inside another if.

### 🔹 7. Shorthand If Statements  
Explains one-line if, one-line if/else, and ternary expressions.

### 🔹 8. The pass Statement  
Used as a placeholder when no code is required.
